Team Assignment (Purpose of assignment-Sharing Documents, Communication with Team, designing a class diagram from scratch):  Use your team members and number. Things you will be learning: 

*   Team Communication:  1:00pm-2:00pm and other times (coordinate with Team members outside of Class time)
    
*   Full Lab days on Thursday & Friday this week to be used to accomplish this assignment
    
*   Github (windows)  Teams will be using GitHub as communication tool to share UML Diagram with your team. Download Windows version (Not command line versions) Use this link for download: [https://desktop.github.com/ (Links to an external site.)](https://desktop.github.com/)
*    [(Links to an external site.)](https://desktop.github.com/)Examine the code in the zip file below: 

**[DungeonSource.zip](/courses/1460174/files/74855259/download?wrap=1 "DungeonSource.zip")**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   Produce a class diagram from this code that represents the code as it relates to redesign/refactor.  You may NOT use the UML generator provided by Eclipse or any other IDE. You will learn (actual and diagram symbology) coding for UML Diagrams.  Your team will build a class diagram using a UML editor such as draw.io . Here is a UML Editor:  [https://app.diagrams.net/ (Links to an external site.)](https://app.diagrams.net/)
*   *   One team member submits this assignment
    *   Make sure and list all team member names (first & Last) who contributed to this assignment.  If someone was assigned to your team and did not participate please list that person as "Non-Participating"  in your list.
    *   Share your diagram and code through GitHub

**Team Schedule for the week...**

Coordinate through the INBOX & Zoom outside Canvas with your team.  Install zoom and breakout into individual teams for communication(all team members need to be present).  List Advantages and disadvantages of working on a team, remotely.  Keep a list and submit this report with your zip file (.pdf format).

1.  **Install GitHub Desktop**
2.  (getting started)breakout into your team and get organized to communicate effectively using zoom platform **_(must be scheduled during our class time from 1-2pm)._**
3.  Lecture on Refactoring
4.  **Thursday & Friday** breakout into individual teams**_(must be scheduled during our class time from 1-2pm)._** 

**TEAM Assignment (10 teams)**

**1.  Students will be assigned a team number (1-10)Redo the DungeonSource.zip using your team.  Each team will do a recording and save as an .mp4 file on zoom.  Yes, your group will make 1 recording in Zoom (zoom creates a .mp4 file) with** all **members(each member must speak in the recording) and explain your project (range from 10-15minutes).  Video required and use of webcams if possible. Send instructor a labeled zoom.mp4 file labeled CSCD212 Team#\_TeamBuildAssign.mp4 along with your zip file.**

The zip file above contains an assignment specification for the first version Heroes and Monsters assignment given way back in 2001.  The zip also contains the instructor's source code for the solution to the assignment.  

It is your job to refactor that code to improve structure, readability, maintainability, and usability.  Employ the Object Oriented concepts you have learned throughout the quarter to accomplish this task.  Utilize patterns we have used so far. (e.g. 'favor composition over inheritance' or 'program to an interface, not an implementation).  Any improvement you can make to the existing design is a refactor.  Something as simple as changing visibility of a method or field suffices.  Choosing better names is also legitimate. 

There are many ways to refactor the given code.  Some of the code uses (arguably) outdated tools from the Java API.  You are welcome to employ current tools that do the job better as you deem necessary.

**Include in your submission the following items in a zip file with your Team Number and listing all members of the team (first & Last names):**

1.  TEAM refactored version of the code label zip file CSCD212\_Refactor\_TeamNumber##.zip
2.  Single .pdf of the UML diagram that represent your (improved) design
3.  Submit a  \*detailed\* document (.pdf) describing each refactor you performed and why -- YOU MUST NUMBER EACH ITEM YOU REFACTOR.  Be sure and include the offending code as part of your description.  Note that snippets of the offending code suffice.
4.   Include a file report of **"Working on a team disadvantage & advantages" Working Remotely team disadvantage & advantages.**
    1.  This could be a bulleted list of at least 4-5 disadvantages and 4-5 advantages. 
    2.  Keep it simple and not too long.
5.  Since this is a team assignment, only one submission per team is necessary -- please make sure there is just a single submission -- make sure the person who submits is responsible and will make sure everything required is submitted and is submitted on time
6.  Send instructor a labeled zoom.mp4 file labeled CSCD212 Team#\_TeamBuildAssign.mp4 along with your zip file which contains your recording of this team project.  In zoom meeting show and discuss all of your code changes and how your implemented them using your detail document you submitted about refactoring.  Instructor will grade your project from this recording (not to exceed 10-12 minutes)

NOTE/QUESTION: How many refactors should you have?  More specifically, you should have at least 8 refactors.  Note that it is okay to submit more than 8 to cover yourself if you are unsure something is a true refactor.

NOTE 2: Renaming fields and methods collectively is a single refactor (only worth 1 refactor)

HAVE FUN!  Always be pleasant to work with and have a positive attitude.
